# Huffman-Compressor
This compressor is based on Huffman Code, and is good in compressing text files like .txt or .bat.
Please be aware that this is only the first bit version. It has not gone through strict testing process so that it may contain some unexpected bugs. However, it has already shown great capacity in compressing text files by around 30%.
